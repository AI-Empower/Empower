## Introduction

This guide offers the comprehensive methodology for a comparative case study that evaluates three distinct prompting techniques using standardized reasoning tasks and Large Language Models (LLMs) available through free tiers. The study addresses the existing gaps in the systematic benchmarking of prompting techniques, aiming to compare performance across different models and extract optimization insights through standardized tests.

## Research Design 

The research employs a quantitative experimental approach, comparing performance metrics across various techniques and models. This quantitative analysis is complemented by a qualitative assessment, providing a holistic view of the techniques' effectiveness.

## Data Collection

Data for this study will be sourced from the following datasets:
- **Arithmetic reasoning**: The GSM8K dataset.
- **Commonsense reasoning**: CommaQA dataset.

Given the constraints of being a single researcher working on weekends, the analysis will be streamlined and focused:

1. **Quantitative Analysis:** 
   - Calculate the **Accuracy** for each model on the GSM8K and CommaQA datasets.
   - Compare the performance of the models across the two datasets to identify strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Logical Consistency Analysis:** 
   - For the GSM8K dataset, manually review a subset of model responses to assess **Logical Consistency**.
   - Document instances where the model's arithmetic answers are not logically sound.

3. **Robustness to Input Variation (RIV) Analysis:** 
   - Test a subset of prompts from both datasets with minor variations.
   - Breakdown:
     - **Rephrasing:** For one-third of the selected subset of questions, rephrase the question in a different way. Compare the model's answers to the original and rephrased questions.
     - **Specificity:** For another one-third of the selected subset, either add a specific detail or remove some details from the question. Assess the model's sensitivity to these changes in prompt detail.
     - **Ordering:** For the remaining one-third of the selected subset, change the order of information without altering the meaning. Check if the change in order affects the model's response.

4. **Error Pattern Analysis:** 
   - Identify and categorize common types of errors for each dataset. This will help in understanding specific areas where the model might require improvement.

5. **Documentation:** 
   - All findings, observations, and methodologies will be documented clearly for transparency and reproducibility.
   - Given the constraints, it's recommended to focus on clear and concise documentation rather than exhaustive analysis.

### Data Analysis

1. **Accuracy Assessment:** 
   - Calculate and compare the **General Accuracy** for each model on the GSM8K and CommaQA datasets.

2. **Arithmetic Logic Review:** 
   - For the GSM8K dataset, manually assess a subset of answers for logical consistency in arithmetic reasoning.

3. **Commonsense Answer Review:** 
   - For the CommaQA dataset, evaluate a subset of answers for appropriateness in addressing commonsense questions.

4. **RIV Analysis:** 
   - Test variations of prompts from both datasets to assess model consistency.
   - Analyze differences in responses to understand model sensitivity to prompt changes.

5. **Error Analysis:** 
   - Identify prevalent error types for each dataset and analyze their potential causes and implications.

6. **Documentation and Reporting:** 
   - Clearly document methodologies, findings, and observations.
   - Highlight key insights, challenges faced, and recommendations for future research.

### Metrics for Evaluation

1. **General Accuracy:** 
   - Defined as the ratio of correct answers to total questions.
   - Formula: `(Number of Correct Answers / Total Questions) * 100`
   
2. **Arithmetic Logic Consistency (GSM8K):** 
   - Evaluates if the model's arithmetic answers adhere to mathematical logic and rules.

3. **Commonsense Answer Appropriateness (CommaQA):** 
   - Assesses if the model's answers are contextually and factually appropriate for the commonsense questions posed.

4. **Robustness to Input Variation (RIV):** 
   - Measures the model's consistency when presented with slightly varied prompts.
   - Breakdown:
     - **Rephrasing:** Alter the phrasing of the question without changing its meaning.
     - **Specificity:** Modify the level of detail in the question.
     - **Ordering:** Rearrange the order of information in the question.

5. **Error Typology:** 
   - Categorize and analyze common types of errors, such as factual inaccuracies, logical fallacies, or context mismatches.

## Validity and Reliability

- **Prompt Design Validation:** The design of the prompts undergoes rigorous validation, incorporating feedback from domain experts and peers. This ensures that the prompts are relevant, unbiased, and effective in eliciting the desired responses from the models.
  
- **Reproducibility:** Comprehensive documentation of all experimental protocols, configurations, and methodologies ensures that the study can be replicated by other researchers, bolstering the reliability of the findings.
  
- **Sampling Strategy:** To ensure robustness and comprehensiveness in the analysis, multiple samples are taken for each experimental condition. This strategy minimizes the impact of outliers and ensures a more representative evaluation.

## Limitations

- **Sample Size Constraints:** The study's findings are based on a limited sample size, which may introduce challenges in generalizing the results to broader contexts or different models.
  
- **Real-world Applicability:** While the study provides valuable insights within its experimental framework, there may be gaps when extrapolating these findings to real-world scenarios or diverse applications.
  
- **Prompt Design Limitations:** Despite rigorous validation, there remains a potential for inherent biases or inefficiencies in the prompt design. These could influence the models' responses and, consequently, the study's outcomes.

## Conclusion

This guide delineates the intricate methodology employed in a comparative case study designed to evaluate various prompting techniques across reasoning tasks. By leveraging standardized datasets and freely accessible LLMs, the study aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps in the realm of prompt architecture. The insights derived from this research endeavor hold the potential to shape future advancements in the field, offering a foundation for more optimized and effective prompting strategies.
