Research question "Does the complexity of math problems affect the accuracy of different AI models?"

Let's start by examining the provided data. Considering the categorical nature of the data (correct/incorrect answers, AI model types) and the complexity scores, a Chi-Square Test seems most appropriate. This test can help us understand if there's a statistically significant association between the complexity of math problems and the accuracy of different AI models.

Before conducting the Chi-Square Test, we need to validate its assumptions:
1. **Expected Frequency**: Each cell in the contingency table should have an expected frequency of 5 or more.
2. **Independence**: The observations (in this case, the responses of AI models to different math problems) should be independent of each other.

Let's first check if the expected frequency condition is met. We'll create a contingency table from your data and calculate the expected frequencies.

The contingency table and the corresponding expected frequencies from the Chi-Square Test are as follows:

| GPT4   | 8                | 0             | 1           |
| GPT4   | 10               | 0             | 1           |
| GPT4   | 12               | 0             | 12          |
| GPT4   | 18               | 0             | 3           |

### Expected Frequencies
| Model  | Complexity Score | Incorrect (0) | Correct (1) |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Bard   | 6                | 0.5           | 2.5         |
| Bard   | 8                | 0.17          | 0.83        |
| Bard   | 10               | 0.17          | 0.83        |
| Bard   | 12               | 2.0           | 10.0        |
| Bard   | 18               | 0.5           | 2.5         |
| ...    | ...              | ...           | ...         |

The expected frequencies for several cells are below 5, which violates one of the assumptions for the Chi-Square Test. This could impact the validity of the test results. However, given the nature of the data and the research question, we might still proceed with the Chi-Square Test while acknowledging this limitation in our analysis.

Next, I will perform the Chi-Square Test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the accuracy of the AI models across different complexity scores. Let's analyze the results.

The results of the Chi-Square Test are as follows:

- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 29.40
- **p-value**: 0.00922

### Interpretation:
- The chi-square statistic measures how much the observed frequencies differ from the expected frequencies. A higher value indicates a greater discrepancy.
- The p-value indicates the probability of observing a chi-square statistic as extreme as (or more extreme than) the observed value under the null hypothesis (which in this case is that there is no association between the complexity of math problems and the accuracy of different AI models).

Since the p-value (0.00922) is less than the conventional alpha level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is a statistically significant association between the complexity of math problems and the accuracy of different AI models.

### Caveats:
- The Chi-Square Test's assumption of expected frequencies being at least 5 in each cell was violated in several cases. This may affect the robustness of the results.
- The small sample size in some categories could also limit the generalizability of the findings.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, it appears that the complexity of math problems does affect the accuracy of different AI models. However, due to limitations in the data (such as small expected frequencies in some categories), this conclusion should be considered with caution. Further research with a larger dataset and more evenly distributed responses across complexity levels would be beneficial to confirm these findings.
