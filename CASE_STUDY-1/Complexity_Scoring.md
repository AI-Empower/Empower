### Next Steps:
1. **Apply the Scoring System**: Each problem in the dataset needs to be evaluated according to this scoring system. The total score for each problem will give an overall complexity level.

2. **Analyze the Data**: Once each problem is scored for complexity, you can analyze the accuracy of each AI model (Bard, GPT3.5, GPT4) across different levels of complexity. This will involve statistical analysis to determine if there are significant differences in model performance based on problem complexity.

I will now begin the process of applying this scoring system to each problem in your dataset. This will involve a detailed analysis of each problem to assign scores based on the outlined criteria.

The dataset contains columns for the Prompt ID, the GSM8k math problem (PROMPT), the correct answer with step-by-step thinking, the AI model used, the zero-shot response generated by the model, and a flag indicating whether the model's response was correct.

To apply the complexity scoring system, we need to evaluate each math problem in the 'PROMPT' column based on the complexity components outlined earlier. This will involve analyzing the content of each math problem to determine its complexity in terms of the number of steps required, mathematical concepts involved, problem type (word problem vs. direct question), arithmetic complexity, problem context, and basic semantic complexity.

Given the detailed nature of this task, it will be a manual process to ensure accuracy in the scoring. For now, let's start by scoring a few problems from the dataset to demonstrate the process. I will score the first few problems based on the outlined criteria.

### Complexity Scoring of Sample Math Problems

Let's score the first few problems from the dataset based on the complexity criteria. 

#### Problem 1: 
"Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three eggs for breakfast every day. She sells the rest. How many duck eggs does she sell each day?"

1. **Number of Steps Required**: Simple subtraction (16 - 3) - **1 point**
2. **Mathematical Concepts Involved**: Basic arithmetic (subtraction) - **1 point**
3. **Word Problem vs. Direct Question**: Basic word problem - **2 points**
4. **Arithmetic Complexity**: Simple arithmetic - **1 point**
5. **Problem Context**: Basic real-world context - **2 points**
6. **Basic Semantic Complexity**: Moderately complex (some inferential thinking required) - **2 points**
    - **Conceptual Density**: Single concept - **1 point**
    - **Contextual Layers**: Single, straightforward context - **1 point**
    - **Linguistic Complexity**: Simple language - **1 point**
    - **Inferential Demand**: Some inferences required - **2 points**

**Total Score for Problem 1**: 14 points

#### Problem 2: 
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that number of bolts of white fiber. How many bolts of white fiber does it take?"

1. **Number of Steps Required**: Simple calculation (2 / 2) - **1 point**
2. **Mathematical Concepts Involved**: Basic arithmetic (division) - **1 point**
3. **Word Problem vs. Direct Question**: Basic word problem - **2 points**
4. **Arithmetic Complexity**: Simple arithmetic - **1 point**
5. **Problem Context**: Basic real-world context - **2 points**
6. **Basic Semantic Complexity**: Simple and straightforward - **1 point**
    - **Conceptual Density**: Single concept - **1 point**
    - **Contextual Layers**: Single, straightforward context - **1 point**
    - **Linguistic Complexity**: Simple language - **1 point**
    - **Inferential Demand**: Direct, no inferences needed - **1 point**

**Total Score for Problem 2**: 12 points

#### Scoring Summary:
- **Problem 1 Score**: 14 points
- **Problem 2 Score**: 12 points

This scoring demonstrates the application of the complexity criteria to individual problems. To proceed, each problem in the dataset would need to be similarly analyzed and scored. This data can then be used to investigate whether the complexity of math problems affects the accuracy of different AI models.
