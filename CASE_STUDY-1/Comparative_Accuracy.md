Based on the structure of the provided data, we can formulate several research questions and select appropriate analysis methods. The data includes problem prompts, AI model used (GPT3.5, Bard), and whether the response was correct or not. Here are potential research questions and the analyses we can perform:

### Research Question

1. **Comparative Accuracy Analysis**: How do the AI models compare in terms of accuracy in solving math problems?
   - **Analysis Method**: Chi-Square Test.
   - **Rationale**: This test is suitable for categorical data (correct/incorrect) to compare the frequencies of correct answers across different models.
   - **Assumptions**: Independence of observations, expected frequency in each cell â‰¥ 5.

### Data Preparation for Analysis

1. **Chi-Square Test**: We'll aggregate the data to compare the number of correct and incorrect answers for each model.
2. **Logistic Regression**: We need to categorize the types of math problems. This might require additional data processing or domain expertise.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: We'll compute the length or complexity score for each math problem and correlate this with the model's accuracy.

Let's start with the Chi-Square test to compare the accuracy of different AI models. We'll create a contingency table for the correct and incorrect responses for each model and conduct the test.
```
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from the uploaded file
file_path = '/mnt/data/testdata.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe to understand its structure
data.head()
```

The Chi-Square test produced `NaN` values, indicating an issue with the data, likely due to missing values in the contingency table. Specifically, the GPT4 model does not have any incorrect answers recorded, resulting in a missing value in the '0' (Incorrect) column.

To properly conduct the Chi-Square test, we need to address this missing data issue. A typical approach would be to impute missing values. However, in this case, since the missing value represents the absence of incorrect answers for GPT4, we can safely fill it with '0'. Let's adjust the data accordingly and rerun the Chi-Square test.

```
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Preparing data for the Chi-Square Test
# Counting the number of correct and incorrect answers for each model
chi_square_data = data.groupby('Model')['Zero-Shot Accuracy as Correct (1 for Yes, 0 for No)'].value_counts().unstack()

# Conducting the Chi-Square Test
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(chi_square_data)

# Displaying the contingency table and the results of the Chi-Square Test
chi_square_data, {'Chi-Square Statistic': chi2, 'p-value': p, 'Degrees of Freedom': dof, 'Expected Frequencies': expected}
```

The adjusted Chi-Square test yields the following results:

- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 8.88
- **p-value**: 0.0118
- **Degrees of Freedom**: 2
- **Expected Frequencies**:
  - Bard: Incorrect (3.33), Correct (16.67)
  - GPT3.5: Incorrect (3.33), Correct (16.67)
  - GPT4: Incorrect (3.33), Correct (16.67)

### Interpretation
- The **Chi-Square Statistic** of 8.88 and a **p-value** of 0.0118 suggests that there is a statistically significant difference in the accuracy of the AI models (Bard, GPT3.5, and GPT4) when solving math problems.
- The **p-value** (0.0118) is less than the typical alpha level of 0.05, indicating that the observed differences in model performance are unlikely to be due to chance.
- The **Expected Frequencies** suggest what the distribution of correct and incorrect answers would look like if there were no difference between the models' performance. The actual data deviates from these expectations, particularly for GPT4, which outperforms the other models with zero incorrect answers.

This analysis answers the first research question, demonstrating significant differences in performance among the AI models. For the remaining research questions, additional data processing would be required, such as categorizing math problems for logistic regression or calculating problem complexity for correlation analysis.


Analysis Code
```
# Filling missing values with 0 for the Chi-Square Test
chi_square_data_filled = chi_square_data.fillna(0)

# Conducting the Chi-Square Test again with the adjusted data
chi2_filled, p_filled, dof_filled, expected_filled = chi2_contingency(chi_square_data_filled)

# Displaying the adjusted contingency table and the results of the Chi-Square Test
chi_square_data_filled, {'Chi-Square Statistic': chi2_filled, 'p-value': p_filled, 'Degrees of Freedom': dof_filled, 'Expected Frequencies': expected_filled}
```
