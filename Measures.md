# Prompt Architecture Success Measures
Quantitative Metrics for Evaluating Language Aspects. Open source education on ways to convert qualitative aspects of language into quantitative metrics (when trying to measure prompt engineering success.) 

Here's a list of techniques I've found so far:

**Quantitative Methods:**

1. **Lexical Diversity (TTR, MTLD)**: Measures the range of vocabulary, reflecting the richness of language elicited by the prompt.
2. **Readability Scores (Flesch-Kincaid)**: Assesses text complexity, useful for matching prompts to audience comprehension levels.
3. **N-gram Analysis**: Evaluates word sequence patterns, indicating frequency rather than themes or style, useful for understanding stylistic elements elicited by prompts. *(This is a valid technique, but it's more about frequency and patterns of short sequences of words rather than themes or style.)*
4. **Topic Modeling (LDA, NMF)**: Identifies topics, showing how well prompts direct the subject focus.
5. **Semantic Similarity (Word Embeddings, BERT)**: Measures response alignment with target meanings, assessing prompt precision. *(Mention of Word Embeddings and BERT is accurate, but it's also worth noting that these methods require a good understanding of the underlying models for effective use.)*
6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detects specific entities in responses, indicating the type of information the prompt elicits.
7. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Highlights prevalent words, showing content focus influenced by prompts.
8. **Text Classification**: Categorizes responses, assessing the prompt's ability to direct specific categories.
9. **Language Model Score**: Evaluates fluency and coherence, indicating natural language elicitation.
10. **Efficacy in Specific Domains**: Assesses performance in specialized domains. *(Domain-specific performance is important, but metrics will vary greatly depending on the domain.)*
11.  **Interaction Depth Analysis**: Assesses conversational engagement, particularly in chatbot applications.
12. **Customizability Assessment**: Measures response adaptability, reflecting personalization in prompts.
13. **Contextual Relevance Evaluation**: Evaluates relevance to the prompt context.
14. **Bias Detection and Fairness Metrics**: Detects biases in responses, ensuring fairness.
15. **Error Typology and Frequency Analysis**: Categorizes errors, identifying improvement areas.
16. **User Engagement and Retention Metrics**: Measures user interaction, gauging interest maintenance.
17. **Impact of Response Time**: Analyzes response time effects on user satisfaction.


**Other Methods (Qual, Semi-Quant and more):**

1. **Adaptability to New Information or Feedback**: Measures system learning capability. *( Crucial for learning systems, but difficult to quantify.)*
2. **Error Analysis**: Identifies inaccuracies, guiding prompt refinement. _*(This is a complex area, often more qualitative than quantitative.)*_
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Provides emotional tone insights, enhancing emotional intelligence in prompts.
4. **Coherence Measures**: Evaluates logical flow, aiding in creating coherent prompts.
5. **Pragmatic Analysis**: Assesses context and language function, informing contextually appropriate prompts.
6. **Discourse Analysis**: Offers insights into conversation structure, useful for conversation-driven prompts.
7. **Morphological Analysis**: Informs on word structure for linguistically diverse prompts. *(requires detailed linguistic knowledge.)*
8. **Automatic Summarization Evaluation**: Assesses summary quality, guiding concise information extraction prompts.
9. **Argument Mining**: Analyzes argument structure for debate-oriented prompts. *(This is an emerging area and can be complex to implement effectively.)*
10. **Emotion Detection**: Identifies specific emotions for emotionally nuanced prompts.
11. **Stylistic Analysis**: Informs on literary style for stylistically targeted prompts.
12. **Intertextuality Analysis**: Identifies text references for literary analysis prompts.
13. **Collocation Analysis**: Reveals word pair patterns for specific linguistic construction prompts.
