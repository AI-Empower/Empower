# Prompt Architecture Success Measures
Quantitative Metrics for Evaluating Language Aspects. Open source education on ways to convert qualitative aspects of language into quantitative metrics to measure prompt engineering success. 

Here's a list of techniques I've found so far:

**Quantitative Methods:**

1. **Lexical Diversity (TTR, MTLD)**: Measures the range of vocabulary, reflecting the richness of language elicited by the prompt.
2. **Readability Scores (Flesch-Kincaid)**: Assesses text complexity, useful for matching prompts to audience comprehension levels.
3. **N-gram Analysis**: Evaluates word sequence patterns, indicating frequency rather than themes or style, useful for understanding stylistic elements elicited by prompts.
4. **Topic Modeling (LDA, NMF)**: Identifies topics, showing how well prompts direct the subject focus.
5. **Semantic Similarity (Word Embeddings, BERT)**: Measures response alignment with target meanings, assessing prompt precision.
6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detects specific entities in responses, indicating the type of information the prompt elicits.
7. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Highlights prevalent words, showing content focus influenced by prompts.
8. **Text Classification**: Categorizes responses, assessing the prompt's ability to direct specific categories.
9. **Language Model Score**: Evaluates fluency and coherence, indicating natural language elicitation.
10. **Error Analysis**: Identifies inaccuracies, guiding prompt refinement.
11. **Interaction Depth Analysis**: Assesses conversational engagement, particularly in chatbot applications.
12. **Customizability Assessment**: Measures response adaptability, reflecting personalization in prompts.
13. **Contextual Relevance Evaluation**: Evaluates relevance to the prompt context.
14. **Bias Detection and Fairness Metrics**: Detects biases in responses, ensuring fairness.
15. **Error Typology and Frequency Analysis**: Categorizes errors, identifying improvement areas.
16. **User Engagement and Retention Metrics**: Measures user interaction, gauging interest maintenance.
17. **Impact of Response Time**: Analyzes response time effects on user satisfaction.
18. **Adaptability to New Information or Feedback**: Measures system learning capability.
19. **Efficacy in Specific Domains**: Assesses performance in specialized domains.

**Other Methods:**

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Provides emotional tone insights, enhancing emotional intelligence in prompts.
2. **Coherence Measures**: Evaluates logical flow, aiding in creating coherent prompts.
3. **Pragmatic Analysis**: Assesses context and language function, informing contextually appropriate prompts.
4. **Discourse Analysis**: Offers insights into conversation structure, useful for conversation-driven prompts.
5. **Morphological Analysis**: Informs on word structure for linguistically diverse prompts.
6. **Automatic Summarization Evaluation**: Assesses summary quality, guiding concise information extraction prompts.
7. **Argument Mining**: Analyzes argument structure for debate-oriented prompts.
8. **Emotion Detection**: Identifies specific emotions for emotionally nuanced prompts.
9. **Stylistic Analysis**: Informs on literary style for stylistically targeted prompts.
10. **Intertextuality Analysis**: Identifies text references for literary analysis prompts.
11. **Collocation Analysis**: Reveals word pair patterns for specific linguistic construction prompts.
