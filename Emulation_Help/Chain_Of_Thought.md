# Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models
Wei, J., Wang, X., Schuurmans, D., Bosma, M., Ichter, B., Xia, F., Chi Quoc, E., Le, V. and Zhou, D. (2023). Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models Chain-of-Thought Prompting. 
## Summary

This paper introduces chain-of-thought prompting, a technique to elicit complex multi-step reasoning from large language models without task-specific training. Chain-of-thought prompting provides few-shot examples that demonstrate reasoning processes as chains of natural language steps leading to the final output.

## Prompts  

The prompts demonstrate "chain of thought" reasoning by providing input-output pairs that decompose reasoning processes into multiple natural language steps. Examples include:

- Arithmetic reasoning prompts that break down multi-step word problems through equations and explanations.

- Commonsense reasoning prompts that show inference chains. 

The full prompts cover diverse reasoning skills including arithmetic, algebra, commonsense, symbolic manipulation, and planning. They are provided in the paper appendix. The full list of prompts from the appendix covers:

- Arithmetic reasoning (Table 20)
- AQuA algebra word problems (Table 21)
- Last letter concatenation (Table 22)
- Coin flip state tracking (Table 23)
- Commonsense reasoning - CSQA, StrategyQA, Date Understanding, Sports Understanding (Tables 24-27)
- SayCan robot planning (Table 28)

## Models

Experiments use four state-of-the-art large language models: LaMDA, GPT-3, PaLM, and Codex. A range of model sizes from 350M to 540B parameters are evaluated without any task-specific finetuning.

## Experimental Protocols

The models are prompted with just 8 examples then evaluated on test sets for accuracy via greedy decoding. Tasks include arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning over 10 diverse datasets. Ablations analyze the impact of different prompt variations. TPU chips provide compute for large models.

## Methodology

This paper introduces chain-of-thought prompting, an influential technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning from language models. The key innovation is using prompts to provide demonstrations of step-by-step reasoning chains that guide models to decompose problems and reason through them.

## Key Contributions

This work makes two key contributions. First, it shows chain-of-thought prompting substantially improves reasoning over standard prompting across diverse skills. Second, it reveals the latent reasoning potential within large language models that can be unlocked with simple prompting.

## Main Arguments 

The authors argue standard few-shot prompting struggles on complex reasoning tasks. They propose chain-of-thought prompting provides models with step-wise reasoning demonstrations to decompose and solve such problems, eliciting strong reasoning skills without task-specific training.

## Limitations

Limitations include lack of analysis on prompt sensitivity, comparison to other prompting techniques, and no guarantees that generated reasoning chains will be logical or factual. Improving factual generation remains an open problem.

## Impact

This work introduces an influential technique for eliciting reasoning from language models via prompts. Chain-of-thought prompting exemplifies guiding models through step-by-step inference. The approach underscores latent capabilities within large language models extractable through simple prompting.

## Next Steps for Prompt Architecture  

Future directions include exploring how to automate chain-of-thought prompt creation, comparing chain-of-thought prompting to other prompting techniques, and improving factual accuracy of generated reasoning chains.
