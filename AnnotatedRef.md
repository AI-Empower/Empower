Adams, G., Fabbri, A., Ladhak, F., Lehman, E. and Elhadad, N. (2023). From Sparse to Dense: GPT-4 Summarization with Chain of Density Prompting. [online] arXiv.org. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04269 [Accessed 9 Dec. 2023]. Methodologies Used The paper presents a novel methodology named ‘Chain of Density’ (CoD) prompting, specifically designed for GPT-4 summarization. This method is unique in its approach to controlling information density in summaries while maintaining constant length. CoD starts with an entity-sparse summary, iteratively incorporating more salient entities in each subsequent summary. Key techniques used include abstraction, compression, and fusion to integrate additional information without lengthening the summary. This methodology is evaluated through a human preference study and automated evaluation metrics, focusing on the balance between informativeness and readability. Key Contributions Introduction of the CoD prompting method for incrementally increasing entity density in summaries without extending their length. A detailed analysis of how varying information density affects summary quality, using both human preference studies and automated evaluation methods. Provision of a significant dataset of 500 annotated CoD summaries and an additional 5,000 unannotated summaries for future research. Main Arguments The central argument of the paper is the importance of managing information density in text summarization. The authors contend that while sparse summaries may lack critical information, overly dense summaries can be difficult to comprehend. Through the CoD approach, the paper illustrates how it’s possible to iteratively enhance the information density of a summary, thus increasing its informativeness without compromising on length or clarity. This approach addresses the often overlooked aspect of density control in summarization. Gaps The focus on news summarization limits the generalizability of the findings to other text types and domains. The human preference study reveals low summary-level agreement, highlighting the subjective nature of summarization quality assessments. There is a lack of discussion on how the CoD method can be adapted or scaled for practical, real-world applications, particularly outside of the news domain. Relevance to GPT-4 Summarization This paper is highly relevant to the field of GPT-4 summarization, particularly in advancing techniques for optimizing summary quality. The CoD method’s focus on balancing density and readability is crucial for creating effective, informative summaries using GPT-4. This research offers insights into fine-tuning the content of summaries generated by large language models, highlighting the potential to improve GPT-4’s summarization capabilities through controlled information density. The methodology and findings of this study can significantly contribute to the development of more efficient summarization strategies in AI and natural language processing..

Chia, Y.K., Chen, G., Tuan, L.A., Poria, S. and Bing, L. (2023). Contrastive Chain-of-Thought Prompting. [online] arXiv.org. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09277 [Accessed 9 Dec. 2023]. Revised Annotation Summary Methodologies Used The study introduces the ‘contrastive chain of thought’ methodology to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models. This approach contrasts with conventional methods by providing both valid and invalid reasoning examples, guiding the model through step-by-step reasoning while highlighting errors to avoid. The technique involves automatically creating invalid rationales by manipulating object positions within valid rationales, using datasets like GSM8K for arithmetic and Bamboogle for factual reasoning. The model employed is the OpenAI Chat Completions API, specifically the GPT-3.5-Turbo version​​. Key Contributions This paper’s primary contribution lies in developing the contrastive chain of thought. This novel approach significantly enhances language models’ reasoning abilities by utilizing both valid and invalid reasoning examples. The study demonstrates notable improvements in performance across various datasets when applying this method, particularly when combined with self-consistency strategies. These findings suggest a more effective way for language models to process and learn from complex reasoning tasks, offering a substantial advancement over traditional chain-of-thought methodologies​​. Main Arguments The authors argue that traditional chain-of-thought methods, while beneficial, do not fully capitalize on the reasoning capabilities of language models due to their lack of emphasis on learning from mistakes. By integrating invalid reasoning demonstrations, the contrastive chain of thought method teaches models not only correct reasoning steps but also highlights errors to avoid. This approach, according to the authors, leads to a more comprehensive understanding and execution of reasoning tasks by language models​​. Gaps The study’s main gap is its potential limited applicability to tasks that require manual construction of invalid rationales, which might not be feasible for all types of queries or more complex scenarios. Additionally, the research focuses primarily on controlled benchmarks, leaving the effectiveness of this method in diverse, real-world applications less explored. Future research could address how this methodology scales with larger models or adapts to rapidly evolving information environments​​. Relevance to Prompt Architecture The findings of this study are highly relevant to Prompt Architecture. The contrastive chain of thought method offers a new way to enhance language models’ interaction with and response to prompts, especially in complex reasoning tasks. This methodology can significantly contribute to the development of more sophisticated prompt-based systems, capable of handling nuanced and complex prompts with greater accuracy and efficiency. By teaching models to recognize and avoid errors, it aligns with the objectives of Prompt Architecture to create more effective, reliable, and context-aware language models..

Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04205 [Accessed 9 Dec. 2023]. Methodologies Used The paper introduces ‘Rephrase and Respond’ (RaR), a novel methodology for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). RaR involves LLMs rephrasing human-posed questions for clarity before responding. This method is implemented in two forms: One-step RaR, where a single LLM both rephrases and answers the question, and Two-step RaR, where one LLM rephrases the question, and another responds to it. The paper also explores the integration and comparison of RaR with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. Key Contributions Development of the RaR methodology to enhance LLM-human interactions. Empirical evidence showing that RaR improves response accuracy across various tasks. Demonstration of the transferability of rephrased questions between different LLMs. Insights into the complementary nature of RaR with CoT, potentially leading to improved LLM performance. Main Arguments Misunderstandings between humans and LLMs often stem from disparities in thought frames, which RaR aims to address. RaR reduces question ambiguity, leading to more accurate LLM responses. The flexibility of RaR allows its application across various LLMs and tasks. Iterative rephrasing by LLMs can refine and clarify questions, enhancing understanding. Gaps The study might not explore the full range of contexts and question types where RaR could be applied. There is limited discussion on the scalability of RaR and its integration with other methodologies beyond CoT. The paper does not address potential challenges in implementing RaR in real-world applications. Relevance to Large Language Models RaR presents a significant advancement in the field of LLMs, offering a practical solution to improve interaction quality and response accuracy. Its ability to clarify and contextualize questions is crucial for a wide range of LLM applications. The methodology’s flexibility and compatibility with other techniques, like CoT, highlight its potential to be a foundational tool in the ongoing development and refinement of LLMs​.

Khot, T., Trivedi, H., Finlayson, M., Fu, Y., Richardson, K., Clark, P. and Sabharwal, A. (2023). Decomposed Prompting: A Modular Approach for Solving Complex Tasks. [online] arXiv.org. doi:https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.02406 METHODOLOGY: The methodology used in this paper is a novel approach called ‘Decomposed Prompting’. This approach aims to solve complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler sub-tasks that can be handled by a library of prompting-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Each prompt is optimized for its specific sub-task, and can be further decomposed if necessary. The prompts can also be replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired. This modular structure allows for flexibility and adaptability in handling complex tasks. Recursive decomposition to handle input length complexity Integration of external APIs for retrieval subtasks A/B testing of alternate decomposition schemes Evaluation on diverse reasoning tasks including symbolic, arithmetic, QA, etc. Key Contributions The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of the concept of Decomposed Prompting. The authors demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. They show that for symbolic reasoning tasks, sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs can be further decomposed into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, the task can be recursively decomposed into the same task but with smaller inputs. demonstrated benefits of the approach: Improved performance over chain-of-thought prompting baselines Ability to leverage stronger subtask-specialized models Generalization to longer input lengths through recursion Flexible incorporation of non-neural methods via APIs Main Arguments The main argument of the paper is that as task complexity increases, few-shot prompting struggles, especially when the individual reasoning steps of the task are hard to learn. The authors argue that Decomposed Prompting can effectively address this issue by breaking down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be handled by dedicated LLMs. Decomposition enables debugging and improvement of individual subtask prompts Additional Arguments: Subtask reuse facilitates efficiency and consistency across tasks Prompts can be selected dynamically based on subtask requirements Gaps The paper does not delve into the potential limitations or drawbacks of Decomposed Prompting. For instance, it does not discuss how the approach would handle tasks where the optimal decomposition is not clear, or tasks that require a high degree of interdependence between sub-tasks. Limitations to discuss: Scaling decomposition for extremely complex interdependent tasks Determining optimal task divisions and complexity thresholds Achieving good coverage across diverse subtasks with limited subtask training data Relevance to Prompt Architecture This paper is highly relevant to the field of Prompt Architecture as it introduces a new approach to structuring and optimizing prompts for complex tasks. The concept of Decomposed Prompting aligns with the principles of Prompt Architecture, as it involves designing a system of prompts that work together to guide the user through a complex task. The modular structure of Decomposed Prompting also aligns with the idea of designing prompts that can be easily modified or replaced, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements. The modular design and emphasis on subtask specialization aligns closely with goals of reusable, optimized, and transparent prompting systems. The recursive decomposition demonstrates techniques to enhance scalability..

Kojima, T., Gu, S.S., Reid, M., Matsuo, Y. and Iwasawa, Y. (2022). Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners. arXiv:2205.11916 [cs]. [online] Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916 Methodologies Used The methodology used in this paper is a technique known as ‘Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting’. This technique is used to elicit complex multi-step reasoning through step-by-step answer examples. The authors also introduce a new approach called ‘Zero-shot-CoT’, which involves adding ‘Let’s think step by step’ before each answer to enable zero-shot reasoning. Key Contributions The key contribution of this paper is the demonstration that Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of zero-shot reasoning. The authors show that their Zero-shot-CoT approach, using the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks. This includes tasks related to arithmetics, symbolic reasoning, and other logical reasoning tasks, without any hand-crafted few-shot examples. Main Arguments The main argument of the paper is that while LLMs are known for their few-shot learning capabilities, they are also capable of zero-shot reasoning. The authors argue that this capability can be harnessed by simply adding ‘Let’s think step by step’ before each answer, which allows the LLM to reason through the task in a step-by-step manner. Gaps The paper does not discuss potential limitations or challenges associated with the Zero-shot-CoT approach. For instance, it does not address how this approach would handle tasks that do not lend themselves to a step-by-step reasoning process, or tasks that require a high degree of interdependence between steps. Relevance to Prompt Architecture This paper is highly relevant to the field of Prompt Architecture as it explores a new approach to structuring prompts for complex reasoning tasks. The concept of Zero-shot-CoT aligns with the principles of Prompt Architecture, as it involves designing a prompt that guides the LLM through a step-by-step reasoning process. This approach demonstrates the potential of simple prompting techniques to extract high-level, multi-task cognitive capabilities from LLMs, which is a key aspect of Prompt Architecture..

[online] Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691 Methodologies Used: The authors explore ‘prompt tuning,’ a mechanism for learning ‘soft prompts’ to condition frozen language models for specific tasks. Unlike discrete text prompts, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned with any number of labeled examples. The paper also compares this approach with ‘prefix tuning’ and other similar methods, demonstrating its effectiveness, especially as models scale to billions of parameters. Key Contributions: Introduction of a simple yet powerful approach to prompt tuning that outperforms GPT-3’s ‘few-shot’ learning. Evidence that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale, matching the performance of full model tuning. Demonstration of the method’s robustness to domain transfer compared to full model tuning. Insights into the cost-efficiency of reusing one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks. Main Arguments: The authors argue for the efficiency and effectiveness of prompt tuning, especially as models grow in size. They emphasize the benefits of soft prompts, which can be dynamically learned and adapted for various tasks. The paper also highlights the potential cost savings and robustness advantages of this approach. Gaps: The paper might not fully explore the limitations or challenges of prompt tuning in specific contexts or with different model architectures. There may be a lack of detailed analysis on how the approach interacts with various types of tasks or how it might be extended or combined with other techniques. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: This paper’s exploration of prompt tuning aligns with the principles of Prompt Architecture by emphasizing the importance of adaptability, efficiency, and scalability in prompt design. The introduction of soft prompts, which can be dynamically learned and conditioned for specific tasks, resonates with the goal of Prompt Architecture to develop modular and optimized prompt systems. The insights into how prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale also reflect the Prompt Architecture’s focus on creating robust and reusable approaches that can steer language model capabilities across various tasks and domains. The paper’s emphasis on parameter efficiency and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple tasks further underscores the alignment with Prompt Architecture’s goals of flexibility and wide deployment..

Li, C., Wang, J., Zhang, Y., Zhu, K., Hou, W., Lian, J., Luo, F., Yang, Q. and Xie, X. (2023). Large Language Models Understand and Can be Enhanced by Emotional Stimuli. [online] arXiv.org. doi:https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.11760 Methodologies Used The study employs a two-fold approach: automated experiments and a human study. Automated experiments tested 45 tasks across various LLMs including Flan-T5-Large, Vicuna, Llama 2, BLOOM, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, focusing on deterministic and generative tasks. The human study involved 106 participants, evaluating generative tasks using standard and emotional prompts (EmotionPrompt). EmotionPrompt integrates emotional stimuli with original prompts, based on psychological principles like self-monitoring, social cognitive theory, and cognitive emotion regulation. Evaluation metrics included performance, truthfulness, and responsibility. Key Contributions Introduction of EmotionPrompt, a method to incorporate emotional intelligence in LLMs. Empirical evidence showing LLMs’ comprehension of emotional stimuli and performance enhancement using EmotionPrompt. Detailed analysis of the influence of different emotional stimuli on LLMs. Comparative analysis of EmotionPrompt against traditional prompt engineering methods. Main Arguments LLMs, while proficient in various tasks, lack testing for emotional intelligence comprehension. EmotionPrompt significantly enhances LLMs’ performance, truthfulness, and responsibility across tasks. The integration of emotional intelligence into LLMs leads to more effective and ethically responsible outputs. Gaps Potential long-term impacts or negative consequences of emotional stimuli in LLMs are not thoroughly explored. The study’s limited LLM diversity might affect the generalizability of the findings. The participant selection in the human study might introduce bias, as their perceptions of emotional stimuli could vary. Relevance to Large Language Models The study is pivotal for advancing LLMs, offering novel insights into integrating emotional intelligence. EmotionPrompt’s effectiveness demonstrates a significant step towards more adaptive, sensitive, and ethically responsible LLMs. The findings guide future research in LLMs, especially in enhancing human-like interactions and ethical considerations.

Li, R., Patel, T. and Du, X. (2023). PRD: Peer Rank and Discussion Improve Large Language Model based Evaluations. [online] Available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02762.pdf [Accessed 7 Jul. 2023]. Methodologies Used The authors propose two methodologies to improve the evaluation of responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs): Peer Rank (PR) and Peer Discussion (PD). The PR algorithm takes into account each peer LLM’s pairwise preferences of all answer pairs, and outputs a final ranking of models. PD involves prompting two LLMs to discuss and try to reach a mutual agreement on preferences of two answers. These methodologies are designed to overcome the limitations of using a single ‘strongest’ LLM as the evaluator, which can introduce biases such as self-enhancement and positional bias. Key Contributions The key contributions of this paper are the introduction of the PR and PD methodologies for improving LLM-based evaluations. The authors demonstrate that these approaches achieve higher accuracy and align better with human judgments. They also show that PR can induce a relatively accurate self-ranking of models under an anonymous setting, where each model’s name is unrevealed. Main Arguments The main argument of the paper is that the quality of responses generated by different modern LLMs are hard to evaluate and compare automatically, and that using a single ‘strongest’ LLM as the evaluator can introduce biases. The authors argue that their proposed PR and PD methodologies can overcome these issues and improve the accuracy and fairness of LLM-based evaluations. Gaps The paper does not discuss how the PR and PD methodologies would handle situations where the LLMs cannot reach a mutual agreement, or where there are significant discrepancies between the pairwise preferences of different LLMs. It also does not address how these methodologies would perform in a real-world setting, where the number and diversity of LLMs could be much larger. Relevance to Prompt Architecture This paper is relevant to the field of Prompt Architecture as it addresses the important issue of evaluating and comparing the performance of different prompts. The PR and PD methodologies could potentially be used to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of different prompts in a Prompt Architecture system. The concept of peer discussion also aligns with the idea of designing prompts that facilitate interactive and dynamic conversations..

Lieberman, H. (2009). User Interface Goals, AI Opportunities. AI Magazine, 30(4), p.16. doi:https://doi.org/10.1609/aimag.v30i4.2266 Methodology: In this viewpoint paper, Lieberman reflects on his pioneering work on prompt programming interfaces for AI systems in the late 1970s. He introduced the concept of prompts as a way for end users to communicate goals and domain knowledge to AI applications. Key Contributions: Proposed using prompts and prompt programming as a technique to simplify human-AI communication and make AI systems more usable for end users. Developed initial prototype prompt-based interfaces and applications like the Advice Taker. Established conceptual foundations for using prompts in AI systems that influence modern prompt engineering. Main Arguments: Lieberman argues that the user interface is critical for unlocking the utility of AI technologies. Prompts serve as an intuitive interface enabling end users to leverage AI capabilities for their own goals, without needing programming expertise. This helps fulfill key criteria for learnability, predictability, and responsiveness in interfaces. Gaps: As an early conceptual paper, it does not provide technical details or empirical evaluations of prompt programming systems. The discussion of interface design principles is also limited. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: This pioneering work introduced prompts as a technique to improve usability of AI systems, establishing critical foundations for the field of prompt architecture. The key principles of simplifying human-AI communication and making AI accessible to end users with intuitive interfaces remain highly relevant to modern prompt engineering.

[online] Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03705 Methodology: The authors introduce Commongen, a new benchmark for evaluating controlled text generation of large language models in dialog scenarios. It contains three tasks focused on generating responses grounded in given persona profiles, topics, or dialog context. Models are prompted with persona specifications, topic keywords, and context to constrain responses. Human references are provided for all test cases. Key Contributions: Commongen benchmark for controlled dialog text generation using explicit prompt-based constraints. Three distinct tasks targeting key dialog attributes: persona, topic, context grounding. Human references for all test cases to evaluate against. Analysis of various pretrained language models on benchmark. Main Arguments: The authors argue existing dialog datasets are limited in diversity and controllability. They propose Commongen as a challenging benchmark to assess model capabilities in conditional dialog generation. They demonstrate that while large pretrained models exhibit strong performance on existing datasets, Commongen poses a greater challenge. Gaps: The paper does not explore more implicit techniques for controlling dialog beyond explicit prompts. An analysis of different prompting strategies could further inform prompt design for controllability. The benchmark is also limited to written dialog, and does not address challenges in spoken dialog systems. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: This paper introduces a valuable benchmark for testing controllable response generation in dialog systems using prompts. The methodology and analysis align closely with the goals of prompt architecture to optimize prompts for intended behaviors. The benchmark could be used to develop and evaluate prompt design patterns aimed at controlling dialog generation in conversational AI systems.

Liu, X., Zheng, Y., Du, Z., Ding, M., Qian, Y., Yang, Z. and Tang, J. (2021). GPT Understands, Too. arXiv:2103.10385 [cs]. [online] Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10385 Methodology: The authors propose a novel method called P-tuning to improve GPTs’ performance on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. P-tuning leverages a small number of trainable continuous parameters as prompts that are fed as input to the pre-trained language model. The continuous prompts are optimized using gradient descent. To address optimization challenges like discreteness and association, the prompt embeddings are modeled as a sequence using a prompt encoder (LSTM + MLP). Key Contributions: Introduces P-tuning method to optimize continuous prompts for GPTs, improving performance on NLU tasks. Demonstrates GPTs can match or outperform similar-sized BERTs on NLU benchmarks like SuperGLUE using P-tuning. Shows P-tuning elicits significantly more factual knowledge from GPTs on the LAMA benchmark compared to manual prompts. Proves language models capture more knowledge during pre-training than previously assumed. Main Arguments: The authors argue that the potential of GPT-style models for NLU has been underestimated. They show that with P-tuning, GPTs can achieve competitive or better performance compared to BERTs on NLU tasks, overturning the common belief that GPTs are only suitable for natural language generation. Gaps: The paper does not provide an in-depth analysis of the factors that make certain continuous prompts more effective than others. Only limited ablative experiments are conducted to understand the impact of different P-tuning design choices. Comparisons on a broader range of NLU datasets and real-world applications could further demonstrate effectiveness. Relevance to Prompt Engineering: This paper introduces an influential technique P-tuning for optimizing prompts in a continuous space that could be adapted for conversational AI systems. The findings reveal GPTs’ greater capabilities for NLU that can inform prompt engineering. The superior prompting approach also demonstrates the knowledge already latent in pre-trained models.

Minsky, M. (1981). A Framework for Representing Knowledge. [online] MIT-AI Laboratory Memo 306, June, 1974. Available at: https://courses.media.mit.edu/2004spring/mas966/Minsky%201974%20Framework%20for%20knowledge.pdf Methodology: Minsky proposes a theoretical framework centered on the concept of frames as a way to represent knowledge and model cognition. Frames are data structures representing stereotyped situations with default assumptions. They have slots that are filled by matching to perceived data. Frame systems connected by pointers also represent shifts in viewpoint. Key Contributions: Introduced the foundational concept of frames as a tool for knowledge representation. Proposed default assignments in frames to enable reasoning with incomplete information. Developed the idea of frame systems to represent transformations between different perspectives. Discussed mechanisms like frame matching, frame-to-frame pointers, and frame debugging. Provided an encompassing theory spanning vision, language, memory, learning, control, and problem solving. Main Arguments: Minsky argues that symbolic descriptions based on interconnected frames are necessary to capture the commonsense knowledge used in human perception and understanding. Matching data to frame slots enables default assumptions to be leveraged. Frame systems also facilitate representing changes in conceptual viewpoint. He contends this approach is more viable than purely logical or quantitative models. Gaps: As an early conceptual work, many aspects of the theory are underspecified, like computational realization, frame semantics, systemic organization, and learning mechanisms. There is limited discussion of developmental acquisition or empirical validation. General AI challenges like the frame problem are also not addressed. The default assignments might be able to correspond to likely responses that prompts can elicit. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: While not focused on prompts, Minsky’s frames paradigm shares deep connections with the goals of Prompt Architecture. The frame terminals effectively serve as ‘ports’ where prompts can be attached to provide constraints and guide reasoning. Frame systems also facilitate representing different prompt contexts and transitions between them analogous to shifts in viewpoint. The default assignments correspond to likely responses that prompts can elicit. The focus on commonsense knowledge representation is also essential for designing effective prompts.

The authors use a set of carefully designed experiments to probe the models’ understanding of word meaning, focusing on their ability to reason about cause and effect relationships. They also compare the performance of GPT-3 and GPT-4 to see if there are any significant differences in their understanding of word meaning. Key Contributions: The key contribution of this paper is the detailed analysis of how GPT-3 and GPT-4 understand word meaning, particularly in the context of cause and effect relationships. The authors provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these models in this area, which can inform future research and development efforts.

[online] Available at: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf Methodologies Used: The authors introduce a two-step training procedure to improve language understanding. The first step involves unsupervised pre-training, where the model is trained on a large corpus of text. The second step involves supervised fine-tuning, where the model is further trained on a specific task using a smaller labeled dataset. This approach allows the model to generalize from the pre-training to the fine-tuning task.

Main Arguments: The authors argue that traditional supervised training on specific tasks can be limited by the amount of labeled data available. By introducing a pre-training phase that leverages large amounts of unlabeled data, the model can learn general language features that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. This approach enhances the model’s ability to generalize and perform well across various language understanding tasks. Gaps: The paper might not delve into the potential limitations or challenges of the proposed approach in specific domains or tasks. There may be a lack of comprehensive evaluation across diverse languages or exploration of how the approach interacts with different model architectures. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: This paper is foundational to the field of Prompt Architecture, as it introduces a methodology that has become a standard practice in training large language models. The concept of pre-training followed by fine-tuning is central to the design and optimization of prompts, allowing models to be adapted for specific tasks. The insights provided into how models learn and generalize from pre-training are also valuable for understanding and designing effective prompt strategies.

Shin, T., Razeghi, Y., Logan IV, R.L., Wallace, E. and Singh, S. (2020). AutoPrompt: Eliciting Knowledge from Language Models with Automatically Generated Prompts. [online] arXiv.org. doi:https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2010.15980 Methodologies Used The methodology used in this paper is an automated method called ‘AutoPrompt’ for creating prompts for a diverse set of tasks. This is based on a gradient-guided search. The authors reformulate tasks as fill-in-the-blanks problems (e.g., cloze tests) to gauge the knowledge that pretrained language models learn during pretraining. Key Contributions The key contribution of this paper is the development of AutoPrompt, an automated method for generating prompts. The authors demonstrate that masked language models (MLMs) have an inherent capability to perform sentiment analysis and natural language inference without additional parameters or finetuning. They also show that their prompts elicit more accurate factual knowledge from MLMs than manually created prompts on the LAMA benchmark and that MLMs can be used as relation extractors more effectively than supervised relation extraction models. Main Arguments The main argument of the paper is that the remarkable success of pretrained language models has motivated the study of what kinds of knowledge these models learn during pretraining. However, the usage of tasks reformulated as fill-in-the-blanks problems is limited by the manual effort and guesswork required to write suitable prompts. AutoPrompt addresses this by automating the creation of prompts for a diverse set of tasks. Gaps The paper does not discuss the potential limitations or drawbacks of AutoPrompt. For instance, it does not discuss how the approach would handle tasks where the optimal prompt is not clear, or tasks that require a high degree of interdependence between prompts. Relevance to Prompt Architecture This paper is highly relevant to the field of Prompt Architecture as it introduces a new approach to generating prompts automatically. The concept of AutoPrompt aligns with the principles of Prompt Architecture, as it involves designing a system of prompts that work together to guide the user through a task. The automated generation of prompts also aligns with the idea of designing prompts that can be easily modified or replaced, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements..

[online] Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09150 Methodologies Used The methodology used in this paper revolves around improving the reliability of GPT-3 through the use of effective prompts. The authors decompose reliability into four main facets: generalizability, social biases, calibration, and factuality. They then establish prompts that improve GPT-3’s performance in these areas. For example, they use prompts to help GPT-3 generalize out-of-distribution, balance demographic distribution and reduce social biases, calibrate output probabilities, and update the LLM’s factual knowledge and reasoning chains. Key Contributions The key contribution of this paper is the development of simple and effective prompts that improve the reliability of GPT-3. The authors show that with appropriate prompts, GPT-3 is more reliable than smaller-scale supervised models on all the facets of reliability they identified. They also release all processed datasets, evaluation scripts, and model predictions, which can be valuable resources for other researchers and practitioners in the field. Main Arguments The main argument of the paper is that while Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have impressive abilities, their reliability can still be improved. The authors argue that by focusing on key facets of reliability and using effective prompts, it is possible to make GPT-3 more reliable, especially in real-world language applications. Gaps One potential gap in the paper is that while the authors discuss the importance of reliability and propose methods to improve it, they do not delve into how these improvements can be measured or quantified. They also do not discuss potential trade-offs or limitations associated with their approach. Relevance to Prompt Architecture This paper is highly relevant to the field of Prompt Architecture as it focuses on the use of prompts to improve the reliability of a Large Language Model. The strategies proposed by the authors can be seen as an important part of the design and optimization of prompts, which is a key aspect of Prompt Architecture. The paper’s focus on reliability also aligns with the goal of Prompt Architecture to create a user experience that is not only engaging but also reliable and trustworthy.

MP involves a systematic series of structured, self-aware evaluations, allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to draw on both inherent knowledge and new insights. The study involves experiments with five prevalent LLMs across various general natural language understanding (NLU) tasks from the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. Key Contributions: Introduction of a novel metacognitive prompting strategy that enhances the understanding abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive evaluation across different models and datasets, demonstrating that MP consistently outperforms existing prompting methods. Highlighting the potential of mirroring human introspective reasoning in NLU tasks. Main Arguments: The authors argue that while recent advancements in prompt design have improved the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, there is still room for enhancing their understanding abilities. They propose MP as a solution, showing that it enables LLMs to undergo self-aware evaluations and achieve performance levels close to the latest models like GPT-4. Benchmarks: Utilization of GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks for evaluation, encompassing various NLU tasks. Results indicate that PaLM, when equipped with MP, approaches the performance level of GPT-4. Across models and datasets, MP consistently outperforms standard and chain-of-thought prompting.

Methodologies Used: This paper explores a technique called ‘chain-of-thought prompting’ to elicit complex multi-step reasoning from large language models. The authors prompt language models with few-shot examples that demonstrate step-by-step reasoning chains leading to the final output. The models are then evaluated on their ability to generate coherent reasoning chains on unseen examples. Key Contributions: Introduces chain-of-thought prompting and shows it significantly improves reasoning performance over standard prompting across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

Underscores the latent reasoning potential in large LMs extractable via prompting. Main Arguments: The authors argue that standard few-shot prompting struggles on complex reasoning tasks. They propose chain-of-thought prompting provides language models with exemplars of step-wise reasoning to decompose problems. This technique effectively unlocks latent reasoning abilities in sufficiently large LMs without task-specific training. Gaps: As prompt-based methods can be sensitive to the specific examples, the paper could more thoroughly analyze prompt engineering factors and robustness across different sets of chain-of-thought examples. Extensions to a broader range of reasoning tasks could also be explored. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: This paper introduces an influential prompting technique to elicit complex reasoning from LMs. Chain-of-thought prompting exemplifies the principles of prompt architecture by using prompts to guide LMs through multi-step inference. The approach also underscores the power of prompting to unlock capabilities without training..

Methodologies Used: System 2 Attention (S2A) is a novel method focusing on regenerating context to prioritize relevant information. The methodology involves testing across various tasks, including factual question-answering, longform generation, and math word problems, to evaluate S2A’s effectiveness. Comparative analysis is conducted between standard attention-based LLMs and S2A variants using metrics like factuality, objectivity, and accuracy. The experiments were designed to assess the impact of different context regeneration strategies on LLM performance. Key Contributions: S2A represents a significant advancement in attention mechanisms for LLMs, offering a more focused approach to context processing. The research demonstrates S2A’s capacity to reduce biases and enhance factuality, particularly in complex information processing tasks. The paper contributes to understanding how LLMs can be made more efficient and accurate by mimicking aspects of human cognitive processes. Main Arguments: The authors argue that existing attention mechanisms in LLMs often fail to filter out irrelevant information, leading to less factual and objective responses. S2A is proposed as a solution to this problem, drawing inspiration from human cognitive processing to improve LLMs’ focus on relevant context. The paper suggests that adopting such a cognitive model could lead to more advanced, human-like processing in LLMs. Gaps: The effectiveness of S2A in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts remains untested, raising questions about its universal applicability. There might be computational efficiency concerns, as S2A requires additional processing steps. The paper does not fully explore the limitations of S2A in handling ambiguous or highly complex contexts. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: S2A is highly relevant to the development of prompt architecture, offering a method for designing more precise and context-aware LLMs. Its focus on relevant context aligns with the goals of prompt architecture to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses. The research underscores the importance of integrating cognitive processing models into LLMs, advancing the field of prompt architecture by fostering more intuitive and human-like interaction capabilities.

Yao, S., Yu, D., Zhao, J., Shafran, I., Griffiths, T.L., Cao, Y. and Narasimhan, K. (2023a). Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models. [online] arXiv.org. doi:https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.10601 Methodologies Used The methodology used in this paper is a new framework for language model inference called ‘Tree of Thoughts’ (ToT). This framework generalizes over the popular ‘Chain of Thought’ approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action. It also enables the models to look ahead or backtrack when necessary to make global choices. Key Contributions The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of the ‘Tree of Thoughts’ framework. The authors demonstrate that ToT significantly enhances language models’ problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in the Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4% of tasks, their method achieved a success rate of 74%. Main Arguments The main argument of the paper is that current language models are confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference, which can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. The authors argue that the Tree of Thoughts framework can effectively address these challenges by allowing LLMs to perform deliberate decision making and exploration over coherent units of text. Gaps The paper does not discuss potential limitations or drawbacks of the Tree of Thoughts framework. For instance, it does not delve into how the approach would handle tasks where the optimal reasoning path is not clear, or tasks that require a high degree of interdependence between thoughts. Relevance to Prompt Architecture This paper is highly relevant to the field of Prompt Architecture as it introduces a new approach to structuring and optimizing prompts for complex tasks. The concept of Tree of Thoughts aligns with the principles of Prompt Architecture, as it involves designing a system of prompts that work together to guide the user through a complex task. The ability of ToT to consider multiple reasoning paths and make deliberate decisions also aligns with the idea of designing prompts that can adapt to changing requirements and contexts..

[online] arXiv.org. doi:https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.03629 Methodology Analysis: The ReAct (Reason+Act) paradigm proposed in this paper combines reasoning and acting advances to enable language models to solve various language reasoning and decision-making tasks. The authors use a frozen language model, PaLM-540B, prompted with few-shot in-context examples to generate both domain-specific actions and free-form language reasoning traces for task solving. The model is designed to generate both verbal reasoning traces and text actions in an interleaved manner. The authors also explore fine-tuning smaller language models using ReAct-format trajectories. Key Contributions: The ReAct paradigm systematically outperforms reasoning and acting only paradigms, when prompting bigger language models and fine-tuning smaller language models. The tight integration of reasoning and acting presents human-aligned task-solving trajectories that improve interpretability, diagnosability, and controllability. The authors demonstrate that by simply replacing a hallucinating sentence with inspector hints, ReAct can change its behavior to align with inspector edits and successfully complete a task. Main Arguments: The authors argue that existing language models, while excelling at various tasks, are limited in their ability to reactively explore and reason or update their knowledge. They propose the ReAct paradigm as a solution to this, enabling language models to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust high-level plans for acting, while also interacting with external environments to incorporate additional information into reasoning. Gaps: While the ReAct paradigm shows promise, it is not without limitations. For example, the authors note that the model’s reasoning trajectory can sometimes be based on hallucination, which can lead to incorrect task completion. However, they propose a solution to this by allowing a human inspector to edit the model’s reasoning traces. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: The ReAct paradigm is highly relevant to prompt architecture as it demonstrates a novel way of prompting language models to generate both domain-specific actions and free-form language reasoning traces for task solving. This approach could potentially be used to enhance the performance of prompt-based language models by integrating reasoning and acting capabilities.

Yu, W., Zhang, H., Pan, X., Ma, K., Wang, H. and Yu, D. (2023). Chain-of-Note: Enhancing Robustness in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models. [online] arXiv.org. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09210 [Accessed 9 Dec. 2023]. Methodologies Used The paper introduces the CHAIN-OF-NOTING (CON) framework, an innovative approach to enhance the robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs). This framework generates sequential reading notes for each retrieved document, allowing for an in-depth assessment of their relevance to the posed question. The methodology involves using ChatGPT to generate initial training data based on the Natural Questions dataset, followed by training an LLaMa-2 7B model to incorporate this note-taking ability. This process allows the model to systematically evaluate the relevance and accuracy of information retrieved from external documents​​. Key Contributions The paper’s significant contribution lies in its development of the CON framework, which markedly improves the performance of RALMs, particularly in handling noisy or irrelevant documents. CON enables RALMs to critically assess retrieved documents and effectively filter out irrelevant content. The framework demonstrates a considerable improvement in both accuracy and contextual relevance of responses over standard RALMs, evidenced by its performance across various open-domain QA benchmarks​​. Main Arguments The authors argue that while RALMs have advanced large language models by integrating external knowledge, they struggle with ensuring the reliability of retrieved information and often fail to recognize when they have sufficient knowledge to answer queries. The CON framework addresses these issues by allowing RALMs to systematically evaluate and filter retrieved information, thus enhancing their robustness and accuracy in providing relevant responses​​. Gaps The paper might not fully explore the scalability of the CON framework in diverse and complex scenarios beyond controlled benchmarks. There’s a potential gap in the exploration of the framework’s efficiency in evolving information environments and its adaptability to ambiguous or subjective queries. Additionally, the long-term performance and adaptability of CON in real-world applications remain areas for further research. Relevance to Prompt Architecture This paper is significantly relevant to Prompt Architecture, as it addresses key challenges in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of language models in response to prompts. The CON framework’s ability to improve RALMs’ handling of noisy or irrelevant information directly contributes to the development of more precise and context-aware prompt-based systems. This advancement is crucial for designing prompt systems capable of efficiently managing external information sources and providing informed responses, aligning with the objectives of Prompt Architecture to create highly responsive and accurate systems.

[online] Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03493 Methodologies Used: The authors propose an automatic chain-of-thought (Auto-CoT) prompting approach that leverages diversity when sampling demonstration questions. They use k-means clustering to partition test questions into clusters. For each cluster, they select a representative question and generate its reasoning chain using GPT-3 with the ‘Let’s think step by step’ prompt (Zero-Shot-CoT). Simple heuristics are applied to mitigate risks from imperfect demonstrations. Key Contributions: Introduces the Auto-CoT method for automatic construction of reasoning chain demonstrations, eliminating the need for manual demonstration design. Demonstrates clustering questions by semantic similarity and sampling demonstrations across clusters mitigates risks of misleading by similarity. Shows Auto-CoT matches or exceeds performance of manual CoT prompting baseline requiring handcrafted demonstrations. Main Arguments: The authors argue that while LLMs have decent zero-shot reasoning abilities, their imperfections pose challenges when automatically generating demonstrations. Retrieval methods sampling similar questions are prone to replicating reasoning mistakes. Auto-CoT mitigates this by sampling diverse questions across semantic clusters, covering a wider range of skills. Even with imperfect demonstrations, diversity provides robustness. Gaps: Limited analysis of the factors behind effective vs ineffective demonstrations beyond question/rationale length heuristics. Does not discuss potential limitations of clustering for highly interdependent tasks. Lacks exploration of how the approach could be extended to conditional generation or other LLM architectures. Relevance to Prompt Architecture: Provides an automated approach to constructing reasoning demonstrations that could be adapted for prompt architecture systems. Mitigates risks of unreliable prompts through diversity-based sampling aligned with goals of optimized prompting. Reduces manual effort in designing effective prompts, enabling more automated and scalable prompting. Insights into balancing demonstration quality and diversity could inform robust prompt design..

Zhou, Y., Geng, X., Shen, T., Tao, C., Long, G., Lou, J.-G. and Shen, J. (2023). Thread of Thought Unraveling Chaotic Contexts. [online] arXiv.org. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08734 [Accessed 9 Dec. 2023]. Methodologies Used The paper introduces the ‘Thread of Thought’ (ThoT) strategy, inspired by human cognitive processes. ThoT enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically segment and analyze extended contexts, selecting pertinent information while dismissing extraneous details. This strategy is a versatile ‘plug-and-play’ module that integrates with various LLMs and prompting techniques, offering an efficient solution compared to existing methods which require complex retraining or fine-tuning. The methodology involves a two-tiered prompting system: the first prompt initiates structured reasoning, while the second prompt distills the analysis into a definitive answer. Key Contributions The paper’s key contribution is the development of the ThoT strategy, which significantly improves reasoning performance in chaotic contexts compared to other prompting techniques. It demonstrates the effectiveness of this method using datasets like PopQA, EntityQ, and a Multi-Turn Conversation Response dataset. The ThoT strategy simplifies the prompting process, reduces the need for intensive model retraining, and aligns LLM reasoning processes closer to human cognitive patterns. Main Arguments The main argument is that existing LLMs struggle with chaotic contexts, characterized by an overload of information, often unrelated or similar elements. The ThoT strategy addresses these challenges by methodically segmenting and analyzing extended contexts, enhancing the extraction of relevant content for responding to queries. The authors argue that this approach significantly improves LLMs’ performance in handling chaotic contexts and enhances their reasoning abilities without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. Gaps While the ThoT strategy shows promise, the paper might not fully explore its limitations in different contexts or applications. The focus is primarily on reasoning and comprehension tasks; hence, its effectiveness in other types of language tasks remains untested. Additionally, there may be a need for further exploration into how this strategy performs across various languages and cultures. Relevance to Large Language Models The relevance of this paper to Large Language Models (LLMs) is significant. The ThoT strategy directly addresses the challenges faced by LLMs in chaotic contexts, offering a method to enhance their reasoning and comprehension capabilities. By improving the way LLMs process and analyze extended contexts, this strategy contributes to the broader goal of making LLMs more efficient, versatile, and aligned with human-like cognitive processing, which is crucial for their advancement and application in various real-world scenarios..
